# BAMBUS-fullstack

This project combines two older repostiories, one for the backend and the other for the fronted. Together they create a website that allows a MANGER to manage a catalog of items that can be borrowed by USERS. The manager can add items and see borrowing statistics. The users can rate the items, request a renewal of the items from the manager and report damage. An ADMIN has the ability to reset passwords and delete accounts.

## Rap About Coding

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell
About coding, the language that casts a spell
From HTML to CSS, JavaScript to Python
We're building apps, websites, and everything in between

Lines of code, they dance on the screen
Syntax and logic, it's a programmer's dream
We debug, we test, we make it all work
Turning ideas into reality, we're the code experts

From algorithms to data structures, we dive deep
Solving problems, making software leap
We collaborate, we iterate, we never stop
Pushing boundaries, reaching the top

Coding is an art, a creative expression
We write the future, with every session
So grab your keyboard, let's write some code
Together we'll build, and make the world explode

BAMBUS, the place where coders unite
Sharing knowledge, day and night
So join the community, let's make it grand
Coding is our passion, it's time to take a stand
